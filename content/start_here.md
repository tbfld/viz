This site presents years of research into the history of what’s now widely — and misleadingly — called “data visualization.” That phrase isn’t inaccurate, it’s just the latest in a long line of names including *pictorial statistics*, *statistical graphics*, *explanation graphics*, *information architecture*, *information visualization*, *information design*, *information mapping*, *information art*, *knowledge visualization*, *infographics*, *information aesthetics*, *scientific visualization*, *visual analytics*, *visual journalism*, *visual intelligence*, and more. True, these things aren’t exactly the same — they reflect different stages, contexts, and uses. But that’s a two-edged sword: if we shouldn’t lump them together to question “dataviz,’ we shouldn’t do so to applaud it either.
